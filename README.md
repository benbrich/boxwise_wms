# Boxwise

Boxwise is an open-source web-app,
which makes it easy for organisations
to source, store and distribute
donated goods to people in need
in a fair and dignified way.

This is a new version of [the original Drop App used by Drop In The Ocean](https://www.drapenihavet.no/en/the-drop-app-2/). The [original app](https://bitbucket.org/wishingtree/themarket/src/master/) was limited to just managing a single organization. This is a rewrite to support multiple organizations on a centrally hosted system.

Check out [our webpage](https://www.boxwise.co) for more information!

## Setting up development environment

1.  Install odoo v11. Together with our partner humanilog, we created [a general dev-setup](https://github.com/humanilog/dev-setup). You have to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed for this dev-setup.

2.  Clone this folder into the [addons folder](https://github.com/humanilog/dev-setup/tree/11.0/addons) of your setup. **Please do NOT rename the repository!**

    `git clone https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise_wms.git`

3.  We recommend that you create your own database before you log in. There you can choose your own log in credentials and leave out the demo data of the default installation. 

    - Open up odoo, e.g. `localhost:8069`
    - Click "Manage databases"
    - Click "Create Database"

4. Activate the developer mode! There two ways:

    1. Add `debug` in the url --> `localhost:8069/web?debug#....` or
    2. Go to settings and click the link hidden beneath the credentials on the far right! 

5.  Install the `boxwise_wms` module!

    - Go to the Apps menu!
    - Click in the left-hand menu `Update Apps List`!
    - Search for boxwise_wms! Remove the `Apps` filter from the search bar to see all custom modules available!
    - Click `Install`!
    
The following steps are required if [Issue #13](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise_wms/issues/13) and [Issue #15](https://github.com/boxwise/boxwise_wms/issues/15) are not yet solved.

6.  Check out the links above and enable the settings / user rights by hand.
